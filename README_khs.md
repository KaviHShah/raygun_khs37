# This fork is to be used to investigate replacing the reduction and expansion functions in raygun to a single function that can do both and is still fully differentiable. 

This is in modelv3 and is known at the moment as: 

ReductionAndExpansionAreaResamp(nn.Module)

Need to implement and test this function into the raygun context

In notebooks I have also added a tutorial single doc overview of the model that I made while going over the model: khs_raygun_recap.ipynb
